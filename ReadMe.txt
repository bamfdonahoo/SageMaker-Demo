This is a hands-on-lab I found through the AWS Developer portal that is a brief run-through of automated building and deployment of ML models on AWS SageMaker. Python and ML are a dayly practice for me at this point, but I wanted to see how easy SageMaker was to get down in preparation for developing a set of self-replicating ML algorithms that I intend to deploy to the cloud for data aggregation. This is a side-project that is in its infancy, so at this point I am building the pipeline and testing microservices for efficiency.
