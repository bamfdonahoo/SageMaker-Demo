This is a hands-on-lab I found through the AWS Developer portal at:
https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-train-deploy-machine-learning-model-sagemaker/ 

Basically, the lab is a brief run-through of automated building // deployment of ML models on AWS SageMaker. Python and ML are a daily practice for me at this point, but I wanted to see how easy SageMaker was to get down in preparation for developing a set of self-replicating ML algorithms that I intend to deploy to the cloud for data aggregation. This is a side-project that is in its infancy, so at this point I am refining my sourcecode and methodology, testing my pipeline and AWS microservices for efficiency/scalability.
